/*

1- O(1) -> it's the best time complexity since it's only run through a constant time.
2-O(logn) -> when using sorting we get this time, because we divide and loop through elements.
3-O(n) -> we have this time complexity when we deal with single iteration.
4- O(nlogn) ->
5- O(n^2) -> we deal with this when we use nested loops, 
because for each i element we loop j times.
